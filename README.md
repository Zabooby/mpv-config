<p align="center"><img width=100% src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/he2a/mpv-config/master/images/preview.jpg" alt="mpv screenshot"></p>

## Overview
Just my personal config files for use in mpv. Contains custom keybindings, pseudo GUI menu and various shaders optimized for animated media as well as movies for use in high to even low end computer with integrated graphics.

## Usage
Download the latest windows build of mpv from [here](https://mpv.io/installation/) and extract it. Download and copy `portable_config` folder from this repo to the extracted folder and you are good to go.

## Key Bindings
Custom key bindings can be added from `input.conf` file. Refer to the [manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/) for making any changes. Default key bindings can be seen from the `input.conf` file but most of the player functions can be used through the menu accessed by <kbd>Right Click</kbd>.

## System Requirement
This config was tested in Windows 10 21H2 and is optimized for use in 1080p resolution for RTX 3050 and can be used with low end integrated GPU like Intel HD Graphics 620 with a few tweaks.
